# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Customer churn directly impacts business revenue. This project develops a machine learning model to predict customers likely to leave a telecom service, enabling companies to take proactive retention measures.

## 🎯 Business Objective
The goal is to help telecom companies reduce customer attrition by identifying high-risk customers early and supporting data-driven retention strategies.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- Performed end-to-end data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Handled missing values in **TotalCharges** using numeric conversion and median imputation  
- Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding  
- Addressed class imbalance with **SMOTE**  
- Applied feature scaling before model training  
- Trained and evaluated multiple classification models  

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Handling class imbalance  
5. Model training and evaluation  

## 📊 Results
The Random Forest model achieved approximately **77% accuracy** while effectively identifying customers likely to churn.  
The model prioritizes recall, helping businesses take proactive retention actions.
