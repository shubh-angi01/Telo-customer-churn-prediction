# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

Customer churn directly impacts business revenue. This project builds a machine learning model to predict customers likely to leave a telecom service, enabling companies to take proactive retention measures.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

* Performed end-to-end data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Handled missing values in **TotalCharges** using numeric conversion and imputation
* Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
* Addressed class imbalance with **SMOTE**
* Applied feature scaling and log transformation for skewed data
* Trained multiple classification models and evaluated performance

## 🧠 Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVC)
* XGBoost
* Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering (tenure binning)
4. Handling class imbalance
5. Model training and evaluation

## 📊 Results

The models successfully identified customers at risk of churn, demonstrating how machine learning can support data-driven customer retention strategies.
